## HappyTails - About Business & Site
The business **‘HappyTails’** is a fictional pet adoption agency that rescues caged and abused animals to connect them with new homes.  The business is located in North America and allows eligible prospective owners to apply online to begin the adoption process and view other essential information related to adopting a pet.

The website is useful in bringing branding and awareness that their service exists, as it includes a home and about page where people can learn about the mission of HappyTails and see the rescue team. The site also allows users to browse through the find a pet page, to see what animals are currently  in the rescue shelter, and from this page, submit forms requesting to begin the adoption process. People can also view the policy that includes rules and regulations around adoption, and read success stories that are testimonials from other owners who have adopted from HappyTails. There is also a page with resources for individuals who are first-time pet owners to ensure that even after the pets leave HappyTails, they are in good, safe homes.
