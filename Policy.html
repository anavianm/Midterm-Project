      <h2>How to Adopt</h2>

      </p>
      <h3>Adoption Process and Requirements</h3>
      <p class="lead">
     Prior to being rescued, our dogs spend their entire lives in small wire cages with only one purpose in life; to produce puppies. In most cases, they have had very little human contact and as a result, they may take quite a bit of time adjusting to life as a family member. Above all else, puppy mill survivors need time and patience while they are learning to adjust to a new, exciting and sometimes intimidating world. The good news is, most puppy mill survivors do heal, do learn to trust, do house train and leash train and do become joyful family members. For many of them, the adjustment period is fairly quick (a month or so), for others, it will take more time. In all cases, time, patience and love are key ingredients to developing the very special bond that you will experience when adopting a puppy mill survivor.</p>
    
     <p class="lead">
     Persons interested in adopting from National Mill Dog Rescue must read the Requirements for Adopting and, when applicable, the Out Of State Adoption requirements and then must complete the Adoption Application. Within 48 hours of receipt of your application, an Adoptions Team member will respond to you via EMAIL with instructions on next steps in the application process. Please note that submitting an application is only the first step in our adoption process and does not qualify you as an approved adopter. There are several more steps to the process, including email communications, telephone conversations and more. </p>
